# General information
For both tasks working directory, because of usage absolute imports, is a directory of the task. E.g. for mouse vs mouse working directory is `./mouse-vs-mouse`. Both projects has no runtime requirements but has `py.test` in test requirements (declared also in `requirements-dev.txt`). Both projects requires python3.7.

I heartily recommend to use [python virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) or [docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/python) for development.
